This is a proof-of-concept awful application to extract salmonella
report files from tar archives

It requires "tar" (I've tested it with GNU tar, specifically).  For
compressed report tar files, gzip or bzip2 are required (by default,
gzip is used)

To see it working, clone this repo and install this egg with:

  $ cd awful-salmonella-tar
  $ chicken-install

Then add some test data and run the app:

  $ mkdir -p reports/master/gcc/linux/x86-64/2018/09/02/
  $ cd reports/master/gcc/linux/x86-64/2018/09/02/
  $ wget https://salmonella-linux-x86-64.call-cc.org/master/gcc/linux/x86-64/2018/09/02/salmonella.log.bz2
  $ bzip2 -d salmonella.log.bz2

You'll need salmonella-html-report to generate report data out of the
salmonella log file.  If you don't have it installed, chicken-install
salmonella-html-report

  $ salmonella-html-report salmonella.log salmonella-report
  $ tar czf salmonella-report.tar.gz salmonella-report
  $ rm -rf salmonella-report
  $ cd -
  $ awful awful-salmonella-tar-app.scm

Then request, for example
http://localhost:8080/reports/master/gcc/linux/x86-64/2018/09/02/salmonella-report/
